## ShallowSea-Toolbox (The app is developed by noob)
![updater](https://lewd.pics/p/u8Nq.jpg)
This is a toolbox for [ShallowSea](https://github.com/carcaschoi/ShallowSea)! Currently it has the option to:
1. Update CFW Package - Download file from ShallowSea-ams and extract to the 'updating' folder. Then manual reboot switch will autolaunch tegraexplorer to finish update process
2. Update ShallowSea English extra package
3. Update the app itself

Todo: 
* Auto Reboot to payload(tegraexplorer to finish the update process) # Welcome for PR, I don't know how to do
* Disable sleep? #As soon as possible



Thx everyone who help me to develop this app
